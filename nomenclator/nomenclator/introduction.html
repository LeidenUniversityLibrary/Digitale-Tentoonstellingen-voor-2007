      <p><strong>R. Breugelmans</strong>
    <p>Leiden University opened its new library on 24 May 1595.[<a href="#1.">1</a>]&nbsp; It
    was no doubt both a stately and a festive event, held in the new upper floor built to
    house the library in the former Beguine church on the Rapenburg. It was graced by the
    attendance of the governors of the university - namely the three Curators appointed by the
    States of Holland, and the four Burgomasters of Leiden - as well as the professors and
    other invited guests, among them the Leiden town clerk Jan van Hout and the acting
    librarian Petrus Bertius.[<a href="#2.">2</a>] It was these two men who had actually
    carried out the work: Van Hout was deeply involved in the building and furnishing, while
    Bertius had taken charge of the more technical-librarianship side, such as the
    classification of the books (and so, their division among the shelves), though even here
    Van Hout had given advice.</p>
    <p>A highlight of the day, along with the handing over of the library keys to those who
    had a right to them, was the appearance of the printed catalogue of the library. This <em>Nomenclator
    autorum omnium, quorum libri vel manuscripti, vel typis expressi exstant in Bibliotheca
    Academiae Lugduno-Batavae</em> (List of all authors whose books, whether manuscript or
    printed, are available in Leiden University Library) presents a number of interesting
    aspects. It is not only the earliest complete printed catalogue of any institutional
    library in the world, it also shows clearly which books were available for study at a time
    when most scholars had no recourse to extensive working-libraries of their own [<a
    href="#3.">3</a>] and, just as today, could not generally buy the multi-volume (and
    therefore expensive) standard works and text editions. This latter aspect also makes the
    catalogue a 'source for the sources' of the Leiden scholarly work of that day.</p>
    <p>It is tempting to try to find an explanation why Leiden University set the trend for a
    printed catalogue. Bertius in his preface does not elaborate on the subject and lack of
    further direct evidence makes it necessary to speculate. As the collection of the library
    was available on open shelving and the books were arranged according to their
    subject-matter, there was in fact no need for the visitors and readers to find the books
    with the help of the catalogue.</p>
    <p>One obvious reason for the publication of the <em>Nomenclator</em> must have been the
    wish to present the university to the outside world. Its founding had in itself been an
    astute political act. In the middle of the war against the Spaniards the rebellious
    northern provinces of the Netherlands had obtained their first protestant institution of
    higher education. Famous scholars, such as J.J. Scaliger, had been invited to
    professorships, and this, again, may be interpreted in terms of public relations
    management.</p>
    <p>It must have been a matter of pride as well to show what had indeed been achieved by
    the young university, which existed only twenty years and possessed a library only since
    1587. Yet another purpose of the <em>Nomenclator</em> may have been to invite donations.
    Quite some attention is devoted in the <em>Nomenclator</em> to donators of books. This may
    have had the effect that prospective ones were implicitly adhorted to join the legion of
    benefactors to the library.</p>
    <p>Publishing the catalogue of the university library was yet another move which would
    enhance Leiden's reputation as a centre of learning. And it must have been quite
    successful, certainly to judge by the numerous students from protestant regions who
    flocked to Leiden. That in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries throughout Europe so
    many more library catalogues were published once more shows that publishing the <em>Nomenclator</em>
    was a stroke of genius. Would it be too far fetched to see Jan van Hout's organizational
    skills and managerial talents also behind this enterprise?</p>
    <p>The catalogue is dedicated to the governors of the university. In his foreword
    addressed to them (folios A2r to B2v), Bertius regrets the loss of so many writings from
    Antiquity, and complains that what does survive from that time, and even contemporary
    writings, are so little studied. He therefore finds it especially commendable that the
    governors would wish to devote so much care (and money &nbsp; [<a href="#4.">4</a>] ) to
    this library. Bertius says that he had to retrieve the books from scattered places, and
    that he had the bindings and title-pages ('involucris sittybisque') stamped with the
    figure of Minerva and the words ACAD LVGD. He also had the names of the authors and the
    titles added in manuscript on the backs of the books. He further reports that each field
    of study was assigned its own kind of alphabet. The 'plutei' (open bookcases) in which the
    books were placed were also designated with letters of these alphabets: Hebrew for
    theology (see folios B3r to B4v and gatherings C, D, 2C, and 3C in the catalogue), roman
    capitals for jurisprudence (gathering E), roman lowercase for medicine (gathering F),
    italic lowercase for history (gathering G), Greek lowercase for philosophy (gathering H),
    civilité capitals for mathematics (gathering I) and lowercase black letter for literature
    (gathering K). Within each pluteus, the books were numbered sequentially. Where additional
    plutei were later needed for any field of study, they were given the successive letters of
    the relevant alphabet. This division applies only to the folio volumes, which were
    attached to the plutei with brass chains - not iron because of the danger of rust ('non
    ferreis quidem, propter rubiginem'). The smaller formats (gathering L) were arranged
    according to field of study, but without further numbering, in two closed bookcases along
    the walls. Finally, Bertius reports that he has set up a special bookcase for the
    publications of those who are in any way connected with the university (gathering M).<span
    style="line-height: 2px">[<a href="#5.">5</a>]</span></p>
    <p>The <em>Nomenclator</em> was printed in an edition of 625 copies by Franciscus
    Raphelengius, who charged 62 guilders and 15 stuivers on 17 June 1595.[<a href="#6.">6</a>]
    It survives in two issues: the first comprises only gatherings A to M, and that is
    unquestionably the form in which the catalogue was presented on 24 May 1595. The second [<a
    href="#7.">7</a>] includes the additional gatherings 2C and 3C (which could better have
    been signed as 2D and 3D), and N and 0. These last two contain the names of the donors and
    their donations received by the library up to 11 August 1595, beginning with the <em>Biblia
    regia</em> from Willem van Oranje. It is followed by the names of the professor of Greek
    Bonaventura Vulcanius; the professor of theology Johannes Holmannus, who had died at the
    end of 1586; the professor of Hebrew and printer/publisher Franciscus Raphelengius, who
    donated an Aetius manuscript in 1590 and on 1 July 1595 added all books 'written in this
    Academy and published by him'; Henricus Bredius; the Burgomasters of Leiden, who turned
    over to the library the books that Christoffel Plantin had originally donated to the city
    on 11 January 1585; Jan van Hout; the Court of Holland, which donated several books
    including the famous Talmud extensively described on folios 2Clr to 3Clr; and several
    others.[<a href="#8.">8</a>] The collection of works by Leiden professors and others
    connected with the university was considerably expanded by Raphelengius's second donation
    and that from the Leiden Burgomasters, which might have resulted in a number of
    duplicates. The remainder of gathering 3C contains the descriptions of a few more or less
    theological works and an index to the <em>Monumenta s . patrum orthodoxographa</em> (Basel
    1569). Another notable element of this second issue of the <em>Nomenclator</em> is a
    series of addendum slips pasted on folios E2r, F1v, G4r, H3r, and K1v, which contain
    descriptions of the most recent donations - only for the folio volumes, of course.</p>
    <p>The <em>Nomenclator</em> is arranged as a shelf-list. The books are reported in the
    order in which they stood in their cases. There are only a few exceptions: if books from
    different fields of study are bound together, any additional title appears in its own
    division with a note of the other division where it is to be found in pluteus x at number
    y. A clear subdivision in the arrangement of the books can be seen only in certain fields.
    That is the case for example in theology: first come the bibles, then the commentaries in
    the biblical order, then the Church Fathers and other primary authors, and finally the
    secondary authors. In philosophy too, commentaries on Aristotle are placed together as a
    group. The original catalogue had no alphabetical index.</p>
    <p>Is it possible to determine the extent of the library from the information in the <em>Nomenclator</em>?
    Exact counts are possible only for the books listed in gatherings A to L, 2C, and 3C.
    These were 407 folio volumes [<a href="#9.">9</a>] comprising 338 titles. These are
    divided among the fields of study as follows:</p>

    <p>The smaller formats comprise 104 titles, including the one folio volume mentioned
    earlier; it is no longer possible to determine the number of volumes in which these were
    bound. Partly due to the lack of comparable figures, it is now extremely difficult to
    judge how the new library, with its somewhat more than 442 titles, compares in size to
    others of the period.</p>
    <p>We can say something about the arrangement of the library reading room. The well-known
    1610 print by Jan Cornelis Woudanus, engraved by Willem Swanenburgh, gives a reasonable if
    not always trustworthy image. Of course, the number of plutei had by then increased (to
    22), and the bookcase with the Legatum Scaligerianum had been added only in 1609. The
    twelve or thirteen [<a href="#10.">10</a>] plutei were arranged in two rows. Each pluteus
    had a protruding sloped shelf where the books could be laid for reading. </p>

    </p>
    <p class="subparagraaf">The library in 1610</p>
    <p>The books stood on their heads in the bookcase with their spines facing out, secured
    with the brass chains already mentioned,[<a href="#11.">11</a>] which in turn were secured
    by a ring to an iron rod.[<a href="#12.">12</a>] There may have been a bench attached to
    the back of each pluteus where the reader working at the following pluteus could sit. The
    two Hondius globes could not have been there yet in 1595, although there were two brass
    'sphaerae'. There were three closed bookcases for the smaller formats, one of which was
    intended for the publications of the members of the Leiden academic community. The walls
    were no doubt adorned with various prints, maps, etc.</p>
    <p>The acquisition of books for the library differed little in essence from that of today.
    At that time they came exclusively from Leiden booksellers, the most eminent among them
    being Franciscus Raphelengius and Louis Elsevier, and from private individuals, both by
    purchase and by donation. There was still no antiquarian purchasing in those days, unless
    one counts the purchases at auctions, of which we unfortunately know nothing more. In any
    case, the <em>Nomenclator</em> makes it clear that a representative scholarly library was
    built up in this way thanks to the efforts of many. Its intellectual value far exceeds its
    material value, and it gave, gives, and will continue to give many scholars both in and
    outside of Leiden the opportunity to carry out their work.</p>
