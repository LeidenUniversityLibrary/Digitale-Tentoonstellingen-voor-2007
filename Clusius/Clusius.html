		<br>The Netherlandish humanist Carolus Clusius (1526-1609) is one of the

		author of innovative, internationally famous botanical publications, he 
		introduced exotic plants such as the tulip and potato in the Low 
		Countries, he was advisor of princes and aristocrats in various European 
		countries, professor and director of the hortus botanicus in Leiden, and

		25 September, 2004), which marks the formal 
		beginning of the Clusius Project, a small exhibition has been organized. 
		It presents a selection of materials on Clusius and his scholarly work.<br>
		<br>Carolus Clusius, or by his French name Charles de l’Escluse, was born 
		in Arras on 19 February, 1526. His father Michel de l’Escluse, Seigneur 
		de Watènes, was a nobleman who served as councillor at the provincial 
		court of Artois. Charles went to university at Louvain, where he studied 
		law under Gabriel Mudaeus. In 1546 he entered the famous Collegium 
		Trilingue. In 1548 we find him briefly at Marburg as a law student, but 
		his protestant conviction appears to have led him to Wittenburg, where 
		he studied with the reformer Philip Melanchthon. On the advice of 
		Melanchthon he changed his subject to medicine and botany. Early in 1550 
		he spent some time in Switzerland. In 1551 he was at Montpellier, 
		studying with the botanical professor Guillaume Rondelet. The 
		environment of Montpellier with its wealth of plants was particularly 
		suited to develop and intensify his botanical tendencies. During these 
		formative years he acquired no less than eight languages and an 
		extensive knowledge on a wide variety of subjects. His first publication 
		was a French translation of Rembert Dodoens’ <i>Cruydt-Boeck</i>, 
		published in Antwerp in 1557.<br>
       <table border="0" width="500" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="table4">

		occupations, for instance as tutor and travel companion to 
		the sons of Anton Fugger, Count of Kirchperg and Weissenhorn. In the 
		1560s he was back in the Southern Netherlands, enjoying the protection 
		of such influential patrons as Guido and Marcus Laurinus in Bruges. In 
		1561 his translation of an Italian pharmacognosy completed this period. 
		During this period his also was involved in the production of the 
		splendid series of ‘libri picturati’, a splendid collection of hundreds 
		of watercolours of plants and animals (now in the Bibliotheca 
		Jagiellonski, Krakow). After short stays in Paris and London, he was 
		invited to Vienna by Emperor Maximilian II in 1573 as court physician 
		and overseer of the imperial garden. This high patronage enabled him to 
		travel all over Europe, collecting information for his botanical studies 
		and introducing a range of new plants from outside Europe, such as the 
		tulip and the potato. In 1576 his Spanish flora (<i>Rariorum aliquot 
		stirpium per Hispanias observatarum historia </i>(catalogue nr. 8)) was 
		published by Christopher Plantin at Antwerp, followed in 1583 by his 
		description of the plants of Austria and neighbouring regions (<i>Rariorum 
		aliquot stirpium, per Pannoniam, Austriam, &amp; vicinas quasdam provincias 
		observatarum historia</i> (catalogue nr. 9)). By then, religious 
		conflict had forced his departure to Frankfurt, where he worked for the 
		publishing firm of De Bry.<br>

		University of Leiden in 1593, a chair which he occupied 
		until his death. The Officina Plantiniana published his collected works 
		in two impressive volumes between 1601 and 1605. Another important 
		achievement was the foundation of the Leiden botanical gardens, the 
		second such institution north of the Alps. Clusius died on the 4<sup>th</sup> 
		of April 1609 and was buried in the Vrouwekerk in Leiden, next to his 
		equally renowned colleague Josephus Justus Scaliger.<br>
