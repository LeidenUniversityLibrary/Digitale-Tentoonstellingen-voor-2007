        <i>by Albert van der Heide</i> <br>
        <br>
        <i>The Hebrew Manuscripts of Leiden University Library</i> <br>
        In all imaginable respects, the Leiden collection of Hebrew manuscripts 
        is a scholarly collection. Written by and for scholars, the manuscripts 
        were purchased and collected, primarily by J.J. Scaliger and L. Warner, 
        for scholarly purposes, and nowadays still serve Judaic scholars all over 
        the world as sources for their research. <br>
        As the manuscripts were never chosen for their outward appearance and 
        beauty, the appreciation of their value depends upon the knowledge of 
        their content. It is therefore most fortunate that in the 1850s, no less 
        an authority than Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) graciously accepted 
        the task to prepare a full description of the collection. His opinion, 
        quoted above in his own inimitable and terse Latin, gratifies all those 
        who know how to appreciate the words of an absolute master in the description 
        and evaluation of ancient Hebrew texts. This excellent and variegated 
        collection is unsurpassed, as regards antiquity, importance and rarity.<br>
        The collection as a whole consists of three chronologically distinct parts. 
        The oldest holds eighteen Hebrew manuscripts from the legacy of the famous 
        historian and orientalist Josephus Justus Scaliger (1540–1609), who accepted 
        the invitation to work at the recently established Leiden University in 
        1593. During a long and active scholarly life, Scaliger acquired such 
        sensational items as the unique manuscript of the Palestinian Talmud, 
        which had once belonged to the printer Daniel Bomberg (Or. 4720), a complete 
        medical library in one majestic volume (Or. 4719), and an early copy of 
        Rashi’s Biblical commentary (Or. 1197).<br>
        Levinus Warner (1619–1665) was an orientalist of German descent who for 
        many years served as a representative of the Dutch government in Istanbul. 
        He collected (and studied) a great number of oriental manuscripts in Hebrew, 
        Arabic and other languages, which,after his untimely death, he bequeathed 
        to his <i>alma mater</i>, the Leiden University. Of particular interest 
        were his contacts with the Karaite community of Istanbul, which forhim, 
        as a Protestant, had a specific fascination. Not only the acquisition 
        of a volume with 23 different Karaite works (Exhibit 20), but also his 
        personal notes in many of the Karaite manuscripts (e.g. Exhibit 5) testify 
        to this special interest. In addition, the Warner bequest contains many 
        important medieval philosophical and scientific works, among which an 
        early copy of the <i>Guide of the Perplexed</i> by Moses Maimonides (Or. 
        18; see also Or. 4745 and Or. 4723).<br>
        The latter part of the collection, sometimes called the ‘Codices post-Warneriani’, 
        stems from a variety of provenances and, although it contains some interesting 
        items, it is decidedly less distinctive. Remarkable nonetheless are, for 
        example,the voluminous liturgical manuscript from Fez (Or. 4814) and the 
        almost completely unpublished oeuvre of the early Haskalah philosopher 
        Naftali Herz Ulman (Or. 4808). In this same category belong the various 
        products of Christian Hebraism at the University and elsewhere in the 
        Dutch Republic (Or. 1459a and Or. 3148a).<br>
        <br>
        The exhibition aims to give a well-balanced choice of the material available 
        and tries to visualise this by a division over several categories. Unfortunately, 
        too many interesting and valuable books had to remain on the shelves.
