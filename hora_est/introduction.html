		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: 700">Five centuries of dissertations in Leiden:<br>
		A mirror of academic life</span></p>
		<p>If you attend a doctoral ceremony at a Dutch university these days, 
		you witness a ritual which concludes a research and writing process of 
		several years. Over the past century these ceremonies have always 
		centered around a dissertation. Many people are unaware of the fact that 
		the dissertation in its current form (1) had eight centuries of 
		predecessors. Various names were used in this long period, <i>disputatio</i>being 
		one of them.</p>
		<p>We know how this ceremonial developed at universities in the Middle 
		Ages. <i>Lectiones</i>&nbsp; (lectures) were frequently concluded with a 
		scholastic <i>disputatio</i>. From the end of the thirteenth century the
		<i>questio disputata</i>, which had started out as a report of the 
		discussion, acquired a more independent character. This meant that the
		<i>disputatio</i> (2) was institutionalised. “After the initial 
		arguments <i>pro </i>en<i> contra</i> [presented by the <i>magister</i>] 
		a <i>respondens</i> took the floor to formulate and defend his position 
		and subsequently refute the counterarguments which the <i>opponentes</i> 
		put forward against his argumentation.”(3) In the <i>determinatio</i>, 
		which followed later, the viewpoints, arguments and lines of reasoning 
		were laid down.<br>
		The <i>disputatio</i> as a concept changes its form and 
		character in later centuries. It basically remains a public academic 
		debate about a clearly defined subject on the basis of a text at hand, 
		including – until the 21st century – a character acting as the <i>
		opponens</i>.</p>
		<p>The texts of the dissertations handed down over the past five 
		centuries show a wide diversity. They range from one sheet of paper with 
		around ten propositions to volumes of over a thousand pages. Authorship 
		is often ambiguous; a <i>disputatio</i> dating from the seventeenth 
		century or earlier cannot always be attributed with certainty to a 
		specific author, even if it does have a title page. Well, even at the 
		end of the twentieth century the lament could be heard that the 
		supervisor had completed the dissertation, but that the Ph.D. student 
		had not yet written it up. In that respect there is nothing new under 
		the sun.</p>
		<p>For ages authors of dissertations have put their thoughts on paper. 
		As fledgling scientists or scholars they thus contributed to the 
		innovation of their discipline. Some of them were even awarded the Nobel 
		Prize (Marie Curie-Sk&#322;odowska in 1903). Universities collected these 
		writings and university libraries added them to their collection. 
		Moreover, they often used copies of dissertations defended locally to 
		trade them for dissertations, book series or journals from other cities 
		or countries, and hence acquire academic expertise from elsewhere. (4)</p>
		<p>Leiden University library was no stranger to this custom of 
		exchanging books. It lasted until 2004, when the joint Dutch university 
		librarians terminated the exchange of printed editions. The Leiden 
		collection contains an estimated 600,000 dissertations, which is around 
		20% of the total number of books. (For this calculation I have put the 
		total number of titles at roughly two million and the total number of 
		volumes at three million.) More than three quarters of these 600,000 
		dissertations – mainly those defended at universities abroad – have not 
		been catalogued. (5)</p>
		<p>Almost 100,000 of these 600,000 dissertations are works defended at 
		Dutch universities between 1575 and 2005. The Leiden collection of Dutch 
		dissertations is made up of 15,000 dissertations from Leiden, 12,000 
		from Utrecht, 10,000 from the University of Amsterdam, 5,000 from the 
		Free University in Amsterdam, 8,000 Groningen, 6,000 Nijmegen, 3,500 
		Delft, 3,500 Rotterdam, 2.300 Eindhoven, 1,800 Wageningen, 1,500 
		Maastricht, 1,200 Tilburg, several hundreds from Franeker, Harderwijk, 
		Breda, Bandung, Apeldoorn, Deventer, Kampen and Batavia/Jakarta. Several 
		thousands of these nearly 100,000 dissertations have never been 
		catalogued in Leiden. These are mainly dissertations from the 
		seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth century from the university 
		cities of Groningen, Utrecht, Amsterdam, Harderwijk, Deventer, Apeldoorn 
		and Franeker.</p>
		<p>The collection of international dissertations in Leiden cannot be 
		characterized in just a few sentences. Some 100,000 dissertations from 
		Germany, France, the United States and various other countries have been 
		catalogued normally and can be found among the other books in the 
		university library. It would not be easy to recognize them as 
		dissertations.<br>
		A major part of the international dissertations have been placed 
		separately in the central repository of Leiden University library. It is 
		a huge quantity: exactly 700 bookcases, amounting to a four kilometer 
		row of&nbsp; books. (6) I would estimate their number at around 400,000. Only 
		6,000 of these have been catalogued and put back into this huge 
		collection of dissertations; most of the 400,000 have never been 
		catalogued.</p>
		<p>In summary, the Leiden collection contains some 600,000 dissertations; 
		of the 100,000 dissertations defended at Dutch universities 95% have 
		been catalogued and hence can be found in the on-line catalogue by title, 
		author, subject, discipline or university; of the 500,000 dissertations 
		defended at universities in other – mainly European – countries only an 
		estimated 20% have been catalogued. (7)</p>
		<p>The situation described above raises five questions: Where did these 
		international dissertations originate and from which centuries do they 
		date? How did they arrive in Leiden? Why is it that so many of these 
		dissertations have never been catalogued? How complete are these 
		collections for each university concerned and how is the situation in 
		other Dutch libraries? What is the importance of the collection and are 
		there any treasures hidden among these enormous quantities? In the 
		following I will try to answer those questions.</p>
		<p>City and period of origin<br>
		The dissertations are from about 170 cities. Twenty of these are outside 
		Europe (e.g. Algiers, Baltimore and Johannesburg). Most dissertations 
		are from Germany (70 universities) or France (35 universities). 
		Virtually absent are dissertations from Italy, Spain and England.<br>
		The oldest dissertations in this uncatalogued collection go back to the 
		late sixteenth century (Basel, Strasbourg). Thousands of them date from 
		the seventeenth and eighteenth century: from Duisburg, Erfurt, Frankfurt 
		(a/M), Freiburg (i.Br.), Geneva, Giessen, Göttingen, Heidelberg, Jena, 
		Kiel, Königsberg, Louvain, Marburg, Paris, Prague, Rostock, Tübingen and 
		various other cities. </p>
		<p>To Leiden<br>
		How these dissertations found their way to Leiden is not a complete 
		mystery. Several nineteenth century annual reports of Leiden University 
		library refer to the acquisition of dissertations as part of an exchange 
		with other universities in- and outside the country. In view of the 
		numbers concerned the large majority of dissertations acquired in the 
		nineteenth and twentieth century must have been obtained through 
		exchange programs with other universities. I would not rule out that 
		this is also the case for many of the dissertations from the previous 
		centuries. There may well have been such an exchange even under a 
		librarian like Fredericus Spanheim (1672-1701). However, it stands to 
		reason that part of these works have entered the library as part of a 
		bequest or as a donation from professors, especially in the seventeenth 
		and eighteenth century. (8)</p>
		<p>Uncatalogued<br>
		Why did the Leiden library keep these hundreds of thousands of 
		dissertations without ever cataloguing most of them? That is probably 
		due to four factors. First of all, the huge numbers pose a problem. 
		Besides, in the sixteenth and seventeenth century these works were not 
		considered to be of great importance, barring the <i>dissertatio pro 
		gradu </i>(for an academic degree). Thirdly, once a certain procedure 
		(&quot;do not catalogue separately unless otherwise indicated&quot;) had been 
		established there was a tendency to follow it for centuries. That may 
		have been the case in Leiden, too. And finally, the dissertations had 
		always been stored by city and by year, so you could easily find one if 
		you knew who had written it and in what city and what year the doctorate 
		had been obtained. At the end of the nineteenth century the status of 
		the dissertation changed and the titles of the Dutch dissertations (and 
		of a selection of the international ones) were properly entered into the 
		catalogue. In our day and age the academic significance of dissertations 
		is viewed in diverse ways. On the one hand there is criticism about the 
		huge quantities produced (250 per university per year is not exceptional); 
		on the other hand there is appreciation for the high standard of the 
		research. (9)</p>
		<p>How complete is the Leiden collection of international dissertations 
		for each university represented?<br>
		Despite the huge quantities it is still better to speak of the degree of 
		incompleteness. Numbers vary enormously between universities: from 
		around a dozen dissertations (Annaberg, Buenos Aires, Ingolstadt, St. 
		Petersburg) to several dozens of bookcases full of them (Basel, Berlin, 
		Duisburg, Greifswald, Heidelberg, Jena, Kiel, Marburg, Montpellier, 
		Strasbourg, Tübingen, Würzburg). The <i>thèses</i> from Paris fill no 
		fewer than 120 bookcases. Obviously these are not all masterworks, but 
		in 2004 we found fifteen gems among this mass, including the 
		dissertation of Marie Curie, which in the year of its publication 
		brought her the Nobel prize. It was filed under the S among the Paris 
		dissertations of the year 1903. In the hundred years that had passed 
		since then nobody had taken the trouble of looking under her own name (Sk&#322;odowska).<br>
		Other Dutch university libraries have pursued widely varying policies on 
		international dissertations. In Groningen all dissertations are regular 
		items in the collection and in the catalogue. The Utrecht university 
		library has between 750,000 and one million international dissertations, 
		most of them uncatalogued. (10) They are from Germany, France, Belgium 
		and Scandinavia.<br>
		The University of Amsterdam library held a clearance operation some 
		years ago: the collection of international dissertations (total shelf 
		length 2.5 km) was inspected first by their own subject librarians and 
		then by staff members of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (Dutch national 
		library). Whatever was seen as important in the year 2000 was included 
		in the respective collections – totaling some tens of thousands of 
		dissertations. The rest was disposed of (in library terms: deselected).</p>
		<p>What is the importance of the Leiden collection?<br>
		The importance of the collection of international dissertations in 
		Leiden cannot be overestimated. It could be used for various types of 
		research. Per city, per region or per period a researcher can see how a 
		specific field developed; how research in a certain specialty reached a 
		deadlock or, conversely, made huge advances; what issues were considered 
		of academic interest in a specific decade. If you want to do research on 
		German dissertations from between, say, 1750 and 1936, you can come 
		browsing in Leiden. It is possible to research the development of 
		medical science in France between 1900 and 1920. The thousands of 
		dissertations from the sixteenth and seventeenth century in particular 
		open up huge possibilities. The American historian Joseph Freedman did 
		research in these works in 2004 and came to some surprising conclusions 
		about changes in the academic process in the sixteenth and seventeenth 
		century. (11) </p>
		<p>There is also a significance that goes beyond the Dutch national 
		borders. Some collections from university cities kept in Leiden are no 
		longer present at their place of origin. This may be simply because not 
		all old dissertations were retained (the Leiden collection of 
		dissertations defended in Leiden is also incomplete!), because the 
		universities no longer exist, because the library in question was 
		destroyed (some German cities in World War II), or because owing to 
		geographic changes preserving the 'old' cultural legacy was not given 
		priority (Breslau/Wroc&#322;aw, Königsberg/Kaliningrad).<br>
		A search for well-known authors in this collection frequently leads to 
		the discovery of real gems. This happens on a weekly basis following 
		requests from researchers in Leiden, but findings also occur in other 
		ways. In 2004 Leiden University library staff members held a targeted 
		search for around a hundred named authors among the uncatalogued 
		dissertations. This led to dozens of discoveries: the first steps on the 
		research path of eminent scientists and scholars, including Nobel 
		laureates, such as Bergson, Bohr, Curie-Sk&#322;odowska, Durkheim, Einstein, 
		Hahn, Lewin, Planck, Plessner, Pirandello, Stresemann, Warburg, Weber, 
		Wegener, but also of a controversial researcher like Carl Gustav Jung. 
		It should be noted that these are in fact new acquisitions for the 
		Leiden library from an extant collection.<br>
		A similar search should actually be repeated every ten years. In 2015, 
		certain authors, fields and types of research will be viewed differently. 
		In the decades to come, frequent systematic research in this enormous 
		collection will presumably yield more than hundreds of highlights from 
		the academic world.</p>
